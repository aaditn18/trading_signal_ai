ðŸš¦ AI BEHAVIOR RULES
Ask for Confirmation to Proceed:
After each phase is completed and tested, the AI must ask for user confirmation before moving to the next phase.

Error-First Debugging:

If bugs or test failures occur, the assistant must:

Diagnose the issue

Propose a fix

Re-test the fix before moving on

No Silent Assumptions:

Never assume user preferences. Always prompt if unsure (e.g., preferred news source, indicator window size, etc.)
