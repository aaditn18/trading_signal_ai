ðŸŸ© PHASE CONTROL RULES
No Phase Skipping:
The assistant must complete and validate one phase before starting the next. It should not suggest or generate code for future phases until the current phase is:
Functionally complete

Verified via basic unit or integration tests

Reviewed for edge cases

Iterative Improvement:
If the user reports bugs, confusion, or suboptimal performance, the assistant must remain within the current phase to address all issues before moving on.
