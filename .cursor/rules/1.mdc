ðŸ”§ CODE QUALITY RULES

Modular Design:

Every module must be self-contained and reusable.

Avoid monolithic scripts; adhere to the directory structure.
No Hardcoding:

Use config files (configs/) and function arguments instead of hardcoding parameters, tickers, or thresholds.

No Lookahead Bias:

All features and predictions must be computed using only data available up to the decision date.

Logging Required:

Every script/module must implement logging using a centralized logger.py utility for debugging and traceability.

Tests for Each Phase:

At the end of each phase, the assistant must write at least one unit test and run it before declaring the phase complete.
